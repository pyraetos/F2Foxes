To begin for this to work you must have xampp and have phpmyadmin installed. 
To get to the xampp main page type "localhost" into your browser. 
It will open the main page you can click phpmyadmin in the bottom left hand side of the screen.
Here you will have the option to create and change phpmyadmin.
In order for this to work, Everyone must have the same database name/names. Within the individual database there are tables.
These tables will have to be reloaded if people make changes and that will be important later on.

For right now to make it simple we will have a database called f2foxes, this will house the users. 
to upload tables to the datbase you can click import.Once there you will have to browse your computer for the new files, they will 
be in the phpmyadmin folder to make it easy. The file is SQL and nothing else should be changed on the page.

To upload a changed file(in that something in the table structure is changed)export it and make sure it is in SQL format. 
Do not change anything else, it may make it hard to upload.  

First table is users and I am in it. you will not be able to see my password, because its legit and I encrpted it, but it is "password".
